===========================================================================
General information:

The codes are implemented in Matlab. The training code can be only run in a Linux system. 
It is not supported by Windows, because of the involved LBFGS solver. 
It seems there is a Windows supported LBFGS version available from
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html
but we have not tested it. Therefore, we do not provide support on how to run it.

All the codes are guaranteed to be executable in Linux, and therefore we highly recommend to run the 
codes in Linux, even though some of test codes are also available in Windows.

For a fast execution, please make sure to enable "parfor" using Matlab command
matlabpool
