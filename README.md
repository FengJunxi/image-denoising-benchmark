# Benchmarking Denoising Algorithms with Real Photographs

##  Task and results

In this benchmark we compare some algorithms to denoise the image. We compare the following algorithms: BM3D, KSVD, FOE, WNNM, NCSR, EPLL. We used the RENOIR dataset from Josue Anaya and Adrain Barbu and we measure the algorithm quality with the following metrics: MSE, PSNR, SSIM. Measurements is made on 20 images 512x512 and the results are not realistic. It's necessary to make a correction.
